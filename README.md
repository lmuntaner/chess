#Chess

This was one of the first big projects in App Academy.

As a bonus, I added the possibility to move the pieces with the keyboard as arrow keys and the feature of saving the game for later. As well as loading a pre existing game.

Start by downloading the project. If you want to play, navigate to the chess folder and run 'ruby game.rb' in the console.
